# Tools

The following tools are essential to your journey through CS50x with Projectstake Academy. Do well to install them and follow any instructions detailed in this guide.

### Communication Channel — WhatsApp and Slack

We will be using a combination of WhatsApp and Slack to disseminate information. We believe everyone is familiar with WhatsApp, but not much so with Slack. So here’s a beginner's [quick guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide) on how to navigate Slack. To get started, download the app on your phone or laptop and follow the invite link in your welcome email to join our Slack workspace. 

### Meeting Space — Google Meet

There will be a need for meetings, office hours, discussion sessions, and hangouts. The virtual conferencing tool we will use to facilitate these will be Google Meet. This is web-based, but also has dedicated phone and PC apps if you prefer those.

### Development Tools

**GitHub:** Sign up or log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and refer to the [Setting Up Your Computer](https://www.notion.so/d2ac44b8ecf249aeba31b661680db515?pvs=21) document on how to install and configure other development tools.

# Meetings

The following meetings will happen weekly, all of which are facilitated by your Teaching Assistants.

- **Officer Hours:** In this meeting, TAs will take your questions and give suggestions on how to approach problem sets better. You will also have the opportunity to share something you’ve learned with other learners on the call.
- **Concept Review:** Here, we review the key concepts covered in the week’s lecture and answer your questions about them.
- **Problem Set Workshop:** This meeting is to go over the problem set for the week and address common blockers. Please note that we won’t be solving the problem set for you, we’d simply guide you through recurring pitfalls.

## Course Material and Assessments

Your course materials and problem sets are live on [Harvard’s OpenCourseWare website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). You can watch this [video guide](https://www.loom.com/share/de832273a619448aab164345f6c255f2?sid=cce10f88-bb15-4a9a-bcf8-3aad54dfe45a) to learn how to navigate the OpenCourseWare site to access problem sets and labs and make submissions to CS50.

After you have been graded by CS50, take a screenshot of your score and upload it to the score submission form we will share on Slack each week.
